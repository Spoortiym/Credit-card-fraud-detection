Credit Card Fraud Detection
Project Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using Machine Learning. It utilizes Logistic Regression to classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent based on various features.

Dataset Used
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle: Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset

It contains anonymized transaction data with features extracted using PCA.

Labels:

0 → Legitimate Transaction

1 → Fraudulent Transaction

The dataset is highly imbalanced, with fraudulent transactions being significantly less than legitimate ones.

Tools & Technologies Implemented
Programming Language: Python

Libraries Used:

NumPy & Pandas → Data processing

Matplotlib & Seaborn → Data visualization

Scikit-learn → Machine learning model & evaluation

Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab → Execution Environment

Project Setup & Execution Instructions
1. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed. Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
2. Load the Dataset
Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in your project directory. Load it using:

python
Copy
Edit
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv("creditcard.csv")
3. Data Preprocessing
Check for missing values

Handle class imbalance using undersampling/oversampling

4. Model Training & Testing
Run the model training script in the Jupyter Notebook or Colab:

python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, Y_train)
5. Model Evaluation
After training, test the model and get accuracy results:

python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
accuracy = accuracy_score(Y_test, model.predict(X_test))
print("Test Accuracy:", accuracy)
Future Improvements
Implement Random Forest, XGBoost, or Deep Learning for better fraud detection.

Address class imbalance with techniques like SMOTE or cost-sensitive learning.

Deploy as a real-time fraud detection system for financial applications.
